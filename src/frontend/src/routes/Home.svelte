        We are
        <a href="http://threefold.io/" target="_blank">ThreeFold</a>
        , and we have built a new peer-to-peer internet that empowers equality,
        autonomy and sustainability. As we launch the
        <a href="https://threefold.io/capacity.html" target="_blank">
          ThreeFold Grid
        </a>
        and other experiences on top, the time has come for us to make our world
        peer-to-peer.
      </p>

      <p class="home_tf">
        On the 29th of April 2020, ThreeFold started a rolling launch with many
        announcements for the world. This began with the announcement of our
        Grid 2.0 upgrade and the availability of the
        <a href="https://threefold.io/token.html" target="_blank">
          ThreeFold Token
        </a>
        on Stellar, to be followed by partnership and product announcements over
        the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p class="home_tf">
        The time has come to start building our peer-to-peer world together, and
        it goes without saying that a collective and equal approach is needed.
        Many beautiful projects have joined the Conscious Internet Alliance, and
        together we aim to empower a better future for humanity and our planet.
