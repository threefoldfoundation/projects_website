            It all started with
            <a href="http://threefold.io/" target="_blank">ThreeFold</a>
            a conscious tech company that saw the need for a new peer-to-peer 
            internet to empower equality (access), autonomy (data ownership), and sustainability (less energy), and acted on it.
          </p>
          <p class="home_tf">
            ThreeFold built an open source technology, a
            <a href="https://threefold.io/capacity.html" target="_blank">
              Grid
            </a>
            of decentralized storage and compute capacity. It created a digital currency, a
            <a href="https://threefold.io/token.html" target="_blank">Token</a>
            , that represents a unit of reservation of that capacity and serves as a fair and trustworthy medium of exchange on the new peer-to-peer internet..
          </p>

          <p class="home_tf">
            .. and started the Alliance for a Conscious Internet - an open and 
            collective ecosystem of do-good projects and people that are committed 
            to build a new peer-to-peer internet that serves the planet and humanity.
          </p>

          <p class="home_tf">
            We aim to empower +1 Billion people with sustainable access to complementary 
            education, internet, and currencies (banking) for less than $1 per month.

          <p class="home_tf">
            We replace competition with collaboration, ego with love and marketing with transparency 
            because we know that only together do we stand a chance to reach our collective goals.
