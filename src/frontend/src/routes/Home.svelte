              our story:
            </span>
            It all started with
            <a href="http://threefold.io/" target="_blank">ThreeFold</a>
            , a conscious tech company that saw the need for a new peer-to-peer
            internet to empower equality (access), autonomy (data ownership),
            and sustainability (less energy) â€“ and acted on it.
          </p>
          <p class="home_tf">
            ThreeFold built an open source technology, a
            <a href="https://threefold.io/capacity.html" target="_blank">
              Grid
            </a>
            of decentralized storage and compute capacity. It created a digital
            currency, a Token [links to Token page], that represents a unit of
            reservation of that capacity and serves as a fair and trustworthy
            medium of exchange on the new peer-to-peer internet.
